-- Regression for the fixed bug discovered by M. Pickering
-- (https://github.com/mpickering) at https://github.com/cmcl/frankjnr/issues/11.
-- The bug was an occurring pattern match failure in the compiler code, very
-- likely caused by a violation of an invariant. It turned out that implicit [Â£]
-- arguments were not considered correctly which then must have violated this
-- invariant.

-- #desc This checks the code which used to cause a 'pattern match fail' in the compiler code
-- #return unit
